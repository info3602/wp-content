                        <p>After her home was badly damaged in the earthquakes, Irmine and her family – one of whom has a chronic illness – took shelter at an exhibition center in Sanliurfa. They are among 9,000 people who are receiving basic necessities like food, water, hygiene supplies, and heating in this venue.</p>

                        <p>In the parking lot of a small shopping center in the city of Adiyaman, an informal tent encampment has been set up. Families are now taking shelter here, after Adiyaman, a bustling city of around 600,000, was devastated by the quakes. Many buildings are uninhabitable, while dozens more have collapsed entirely.
                            Among those who have found safety in this parking lot is Mehmet and his extended family of 20 – the oldest being 70, the youngest just five. </p>

                        <p>We met Burak and his parents sitting by a fire outside a completely destroyed building in Adiyaman, Turkey, that was previously their family home. Once eight floors tall, the building is now just one storey high, having collapsed to a pile of rubble following the earthquake. The family were buried beneath the wreckage, but miraculously managed to escape. Burak, a mariner by profession, has now been living on the street for five days and nights, facing brutally cold temperatures</p>
